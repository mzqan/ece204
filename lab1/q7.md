# Question 7
For a given $n \times n$ column-stochastic matrix $A$ and a $n$-dimensional stochastic vector $u$, the normalized eigenvector $\hat{v}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue of $1$ for $A$ is equal to the limit vector, $\lim_{k \to \infty} A^ku = \hat{v}$.

This means that the limiting vector $\lim_{k \to \infty} A^ku$ can be easily determined by normalizing the eigenvector $v$ corresponding to the eigenvalue of $1$ instead of performing many computations.

We will find the steady state of our wireless sensor system as an example,

A = [0.4 0.1;
     0.6 0.9];  % transition matrix

[U, D] = eig(A);

v0 = [0; 1]; % initial state vector representing idle

V = zeros(2, 101);
V(:,1) = v0;

for k = 1:100
    V(:,k+1) = A * V(:,k);
end

D % eigen values of A, there will always be 1

D =
