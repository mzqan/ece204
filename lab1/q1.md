# Question 1

## Q1.1

No, $1_n$ is not an eigenvector of $A$. Here's a counter example:

Let $A$ be a random stochastic 2x2 matrix, $u$ = $1_n$  

```matlab
>> format long
>> A = rand(2,2); A = A./sum(A)

A =

   0.866364636788454   0.337418288844332
   0.133635363211546   0.662581711155668

>> u = ones(2,1)

u =

     1
     1

>> A*u

ans =

   1.203782925632786
   0.796217074367214
```

Note that, 
$Au$ is **NOT** a scalar multiple of $u$.
That is, there exists no $\lambda$ such that $A1_n = \lambda1_n$

Therefore $1_n$ is not an eigenvector of $A$.

## Q1.2
Computing $A^\top1_n$ numerically for serveral randomy generated column-stochastic matrices $A$.

```matlab
>> format long
>> A = rand(2,2); A = A./sum(A)

A =

   0.498080077626658   0.139702413172387
   0.501919922373342   0.860297586827613

>> u = ones(2,1)

u =

     1
     1

>> A'*u

ans =

     1
     1

>> 

>> A = rand(2,2); A = A./sum(A)

A =

   0.663527683866133   0.849404227048400
   0.336472316133867   0.150595772951600

>> u = ones(2,1)

u =

     1
     1

>> A'*u

ans =

     1
     1

```

We observed, the matrix-vector product, $A^\top1_n$, always results in $1_n$.

This is because, by matrix multiplication, multiplying $A^\top$ by $1_n$ computes the sum of entries in each row of $A_\top$. 
Since the sum of each column in a column-stochastic matrix is always $1$, this implies that each row of $A^\top$ sums to $1$. Thus, $A^\top1_n = 1_n$.

## Q1.3

We can conclude that $1_n$ is an eigenvector of $A^\top$ with an eigenvalue of 1.
It follows that $1$ must always be an eigenvalue of the transpose of a column-stochastic matrix.
