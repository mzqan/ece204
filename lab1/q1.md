# Question 1

## Q1.1

Generate a random stochastic matrix:

```
>> format long
>> A = rand(2,2);
>> A = A./sum(A)

A =

   0.866364636788454   0.337418288844332
   0.133635363211546   0.662581711155668

>> u = [1,1]'

u =

     1
     1

>> A*u

ans =

   1.203782925632786
   0.796217074367214
```

Letting u = $\textbf{1}_n$

A*u is not a scalar multiple of u

Thus this cannot satisfy lambda * u for a scalar eigenvalue lambda
Therefore u is not a eigenvector of A

## Q1.2

```
B = rand(2,2);
B = B./sum(B)

B =

   0.040359430905736   0.579138586660293
   0.959640569094264   0.420861413339707

>> B'*u

ans =

     1
     1

>> C = rand(2,2);
C = C./sum(C)

C =

   0.504866389880806   0.374367835731618
   0.495133610119194   0.625632164268383

>> C'*u

ans =

     1
     1
```

The result is always the same as u. The matrix multiplication leaves the vector unchanged.
This is because, by matrix multiplication, this multiplies 1 to each column and sums.
The sum of each column is already 1, so the vector sum is n, the same as the column sum of u.

(bad explanation)

## Q1.3

u is an eigenvector of $A^\top$ with an eigenvalue of 1.
This implies that 1 must always be an eigenvalue of the transpose of a column-stochastic matrix.
