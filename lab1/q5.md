# Question 5

Let $A$ be a column-stochastic matrix.
Assume for the sake of contradiction, $A$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda > 1$

From Q3, we know that a random square matrix and its transpose share the same eigenvalues. Thus, $A^\top u=\lambda u$ for some eigenvector $u\ne0$.

Now let $u_k$ be the entry of eigenvector $u$ with the largest absolute value.

$ \lambda u_k =(A^\top u)_k = \sum_{i=1}^n (A^\top)_{ki}u =\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ik}u$.

Note that the last expression represents a convex combination, aka a weighted average where each weight $a_{ik}$ satisfies $0 \le a_{ik} \le 1$. We know this is true because the sum of all entries for a given column $k$ of a column-stochastic matrix will equal $1$, in other words, $\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ik}=1$.

Since $\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ik}u$ represents a convex combination, the following property holds:
$min(u_1, u_2, ..., u_n) \le \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ik}u \le max(u_1, u_2, ..., u_n) $

Since all columns of $A$ and $A^\top$ are non-negative, this also implies: $$\begin{aligned} |(A^\top u)_k|  = |\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ik}u| &\le max(u_1, u_2, ..., u_n) \le max(|u_1|, |u_2|, ..., |u_n|)= |u_k| \\ |\lambda u_k| =| (A^\top u)_k|   &\le |u_k| \\ 
|\lambda| &\le 1 
\end{aligned}$$


Since $|\lambda| \le 1$ is a contradiction, therefore our assumption, $\lambda > 1$, is incorrect. 

Therefore, a column-stochastic matrix cannot have an eigenvalue that is greater than $1$.
