# Question 2

Let $A$ be a $n \times n$ column-stochastic matrix with entries $a_{i,j}$. Let $v$ be the result of the matrix-vector product $A^\top1_n$.

We want to show that, $A^\top$ $\textbf{1}_n$ = $\textbf{1}_n$. Or, in other words, $v = 1_n$.

To calculate the $k^{th}$ entry of $v$ the product of $A^\top1_n$, we use the following summation:

$v_k = \sum_{j=1}^n (A^\top)_{k,j}(1_n)_j$

Since we are using the transpose, $(A^\top)_{k,j} = a_{j,k}$. Also note that, $(1_n)_j = 1$. Simplifying the above expression now gives: 
$v_k = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{j,k}$

We know that the sum of entries in each column of a column-stochastic matrix is always $1$. It follows that, each row of the transpose $A^\top$ sums to $1$.
Thus, the entry $v_k = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{j,k} = 1$. And as a result, $v = 1_n$.

Therefore, $A^\top1_n = 1_n$.

As a quick example,
```matlab
>> A = rand(2,2);
A = A./sum(A)

A =

   0.322193780009316   0.542359992490573
   0.677806219990684   0.457640007509427

>> for k = 1:2
    sum(A(:, k))
end

ans =

     1


ans =

     1

```
