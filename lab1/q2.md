# Question 2

Debrief:
Sum of values in each column = 1. Sum of entries in each row of the transpose = 1.
Question is asking us to prove the property in question 1. 

Prove:

$A^\top$ $\textbf{1}_n$ = $\textbf{1}_n$

Calculating the kth entry of the product $A^\top$ $\textbf{1}_n$ is given by

$\sum_{i = 1}^n a_{j,i}$


```
>> A = rand(2,2);
A = A./sum(A)

A =

   0.322193780009316   0.542359992490573
   0.677806219990684   0.457640007509427

>> for k = 1:2
    sum(A(:, k))
end

ans =

     1


ans =

     1

```

(Not sure how else to do this question, need better proof)
